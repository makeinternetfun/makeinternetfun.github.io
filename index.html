    <h1>Manifesto</h1>
    <p>We need to make the Internet a fun place again.</p>
    <p>The quirky, the kooky, the ugly, the imperfect.</p>
    <p>The creative, the mind-bending, the laugh out loud place it used to be.</p>
    <p>No more autonomous doom scrolling. No more click-baiting.</p>
    <p>No more problem solving. We've solved all the important problems that can be addressed digitally.</p>
    <p>Now we're just running up the scoreboard. Solving micro problems.</p>
    <p>Time to take your life back.</p>
    <p>Reclaim the joy of living.</p>
