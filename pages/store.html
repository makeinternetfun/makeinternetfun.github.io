    <div>
        <h2>Placeholder</h2>
        <p>
            This is a placeholder page for what will be an online store. Did you know you can sell
            goods and services on the internet?
        </p>

            Only idea at the moment is to slap the image from the home page onto a shirt and perhaps a trucker cap.
