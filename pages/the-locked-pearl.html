        <h2>Concept</h2>
        <p>A dream journal site where users can record the dreams they had while sleeping.</p>
        <p>
            Optionally, they'll be able to generate photos or videos based on the descriptions
            and other characteristics of the dreams.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'd like to try and do some other wild stuff like be able to 'stitch' together
            multiple dreams into a single narrative, or generate a 'dream map' that shows
            how different dreams are related to each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a real project and the very primative beta version is basically done, so it
            should be linked here in the coming weeks.
