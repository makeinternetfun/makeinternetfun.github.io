        <h2>Concept</h2>
        <p>I want to digitally re-create the feeling of "swiping" into the NYC subway.</p>
        <p>
            Did you know that they are gettiing rid of MetroCards? I mean, kind of overdue,
            but now that it's happening, man, it was quite an era to have to swipe those
            flimsy cards just perfectly to get through the turnstile right as your train
            was arriving.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, I want to make a web version of that. Rough idea is that there will be a train
            that runs on a fixed schedule, and you have to swipe your card to get in on time.
            If you miss it, you have to wait for the next one. Or I suppose you could wait on
            the platform. But then, once you're on, you'll go for a brief ride, then the doors
            will open, and it will take you to some fun, or unexpected place.
